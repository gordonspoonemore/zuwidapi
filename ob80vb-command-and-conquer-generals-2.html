                            <p> Take a first-person view of the CC universe through Command & Conquer: Renegade – the series’ one and only first-person shooter – or start playing from the very beginning and enjoy the frenetic style of combat, immersive strategy and campy banter that launched a generation of strategy warfare games. Command & Conquer goes free-to-play with Generals 2. Free-to-play future 'tough' for some to understand, says EA exec. Company COO Peter Moore proclaims "free-to-play is the future,".

So what do you guys think this could be? Some other form of Generals remake? Or another Command & Conquer Red Alert sequel? This could be nothing but the Command & Conquer brand is a cash cow and EA needs a big win after the Star Wars fiasco and what better Command & Conquer (previously known as Command & Conquer: Generals 2) is a cancelled real-time strategy video game in the Command & Conquer series.It was being developed by the now-closed video game studio Victory Games for Microsoft Windows. Command & Conquer Generals 2 (now known as "Command & Conquer," and also called by the moniker "CC" or "CnC"), the infamous strategy video game that was scrapped in 2013, is said to be in the process of revival according to its first producer, Electronic Can We Reach 500 Likes?

This is a MOD for Command Conquer:Zero Hour, We are ready reference Generals 2 (FTP) model to create a new model of buildings and units, the number of units of each faction to prevail Zero Hour, the unit will differ from nature (such as the Hummer into infantry units), the total number of units unchanged. Heloo im a big fan of the command and conquer series and i will do anyting to play a game of command and conquer 2 I dont care what version it is I will even play it with bots Or not even with bots but i just want to play 1 game of it Plz upvote its a big dream. The only other F2P MMORTS I can think of off the top of my head is End of Nations; Is EA trying to compete there? If this game sets precedence, do you think we will see more "traditional" games being marketed Ok quick backstory, i just installed these games off of discs an old friend gave me. He also gave me Yuri's Revenge. Ive been binging the CampC series with CNC Net, but i wanted to see what some of the newer better graphics games were like since all i have been playing were 16 bit. So Red Alert 2, Yuri's Revenge, and Command and Conquers Generals + Zero Hour installed without a hitch, and i waited before installing CNC net to Red Alert 2 and tried the game out. I opened it and at first UPDATE: So I made some big changes based off your responses and some of my coworkers. Please tell me what you guys think. Here is what I changed. 1) Mother Board - Was told a normal sized ATX was better than a mini, the new one I picked also has wifi capabilities. 2) Memory Sticks - Chose ones with RGB lighting. If you couldn't tell already I love lights. Seemed like these new ones have good reviews. 3) Internal Hard Drive - Changed my internal hard drive from 5400 rpm to be above 7000rpm. 
Just bought a new PC and I've been out of PC gaming for 15 years. I'm itching for a modern RTS game with nice graphics that plays similar to Command and Conquer Generals. Doesn't have to be that type of setting. Anything good but relatively new and has nice graphics. Nothing older than 2013 or so. There are so many choices when I search that it's overwhelming, maybe you guys can help with some recommendations. Thanks in advance. I should probably add that I’m a massive RTS fan with too many hours logged on Command and Conquer: Generals and Age of Empires 3. I have personally played tropico 5 on the ps4 and I liked it but I came with the wrong approach (too trigger happy) so i left a bit disappointed but i loved the gameplay. Rome: Total war on the other hand seems like an RTS but due to the lack of reddit threads specifically on the game mechanics alas I’m unable to understand how it works. My question here is for those. I recently started playing red alert command and conquer generals with my two kids and they are having an absolute blast but it feels dated (I had to explain what an internet cafe was to them :D). What is great is on a skirmish we can all be one team against whatever we want. Are there any other games you think we should hit up? \- It must be suitable for kids (12 max) \- It must work on a lan at least \- ideally we can work as a team (at least at first to help them learn) amp#x200B;. </p>
