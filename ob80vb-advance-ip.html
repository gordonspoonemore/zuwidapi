                            <p> My PLEX server is having issues connecting through port 32400. It is not typical port forwarding issues. It is currently being used on a school network which provides external IPs to each LAN port so all ports are open and no port forwarding is required. How the school achieves this is somehow messing with Plex's ability to connect. I believe its an issue with the main plex server not reading my ip correctly. Are there any advance config files i can tinker with to set my external. Does anyone know for sure if/what the additional cost for IPs on the new Advance Range is? They just say this: gt Each server has a public IPv4 address and an IPv6 address range. As an option, you can rent additional IPv4 addresses for your dedicated server (up to 256 per machine). I'm not sure if this is the normal "pay once to activate a new IP", or a monthly charge Senate advances bill warning against 'precipitous withdrawal' from Syria and Afghanistan (https://reddit.com//r/worldnews/comments/am1w5o) Go1dfish undelete link ( unreddit undelete link (https://unreddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/am1w5o) Author: /u/ip_g_chodder. Hi everyone, I recently completed an Unraid install in a new server. Everything is working great but I do have one issue which is driving me crazy: Very often (once every hour or so) the GUI will hang and the server will disappear. When I go to TOWER/ on my browser I get a random printer setup page that has nothing to with Unraid. A lot of my dockers will then stop working (but not strangely my Windows VM). Refreshing a couple of times or rebooting the server usually fixes this but it's extrem. 
Let's assume we get all the franchises the community is asking or speculating for. what major franchises would Nintendo have left beyond these wouldn't be repeated outings for switch? (Either in sequels or new entries) We've got mainline Mario, Zelda, Mario Kart, Splatoon, Kirby and Donkey Kong. (Yes, two are ports) Pokemon, Yoshi, Fire Emblem Smash and Metroid have all been announced. Animal crossing is desperately wanted amp Pikmin 4 has been in development for years - If AC and Pikmin. desired screen size : any size is ok, the smaller the better country code : US or Europe budget : not a question usage requirements : mainly text + heavy browsing Previous request: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/7nhkcq/flickerfree_igzo_i5i7_without_vendorlocks/. Did the Nintendo Switch cause you to get your first Nintendo system, or your first one in a long time? I know people with a Switch who haven't had a Nintendo system since the Gamecube and Gameboy advance and even someone who hasn't had a Nintendo since the N64. They just stuck with the Xbox or Playstation. I know that sales for this are high, so I was just curious to see how many aren't the usual Nintendo buyers We all know that using remote nodes leak your IP, but will a VPN prevent. Is it me or is GTA V going to shit? I have everything maxed out including 8x Msaa and it looks like it does on a Xbox 360. And know matter what I do, it wont get any better. Im at 1920x1080. and it runs between 45and 55 fps on a fresh install. First pitch: 1:07 pm EST (Florida Auto Exchange Stadium, Dunedin) Probable starters: Matt Boyd vs. R.A.

Total budget and country of purchase: Around 0 USD but if there is a big advantage for a little more will consider raising it. Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply. Specs and battery but specs are more important How important is weight to you? Moderator Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac. Windows Do you have a preferred screen size? If indiffe. I thought of this idea a while back, having Nintendo movies, then all the characters meet up in a Smash Bros. movie. Questions for everyone- -Animation style? (3D? Anime?) -IP's included? -Best way to make them all meet in a Smash movie? (If you think that should happen) -Who should be the villains? (Alongside Master Hand) -How much phases would be the perfect amount? -Easter Eggs included? My Answers- 1. Anime, Kid Icarus style (Second option would be animation like the Sm4sh. </p>
