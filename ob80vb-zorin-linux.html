We have had HN service for the past year due to lack of other available "high speed" internet in our very rural area. We have a 10 gig per month data cap. Usually we go through the 10 gig in 20-25 days and buy 3 tokens to get through the last bit of the 30 day period. This month just rolled over on April 26 and we have already used 7 gig of data!

I am a long time windows user and have been trying linux for about a month. When I installed linux and dual boot with windows 10 I thought I would delete windows very soon. I tried a few distros such as ubuntu, zorin, linux mint and xubuntu and generally speaking I prefer Linux over Windows. However the following still keeps me from deleting windows: 1, I have to login back to windows to use Adobe Reader DC to open PDF forms. I tried desperately to open those forms in linux, to no avail. I have Crunchbang installed on my Acer Aspire One. I want to put any of the following distros on it instead: LXLE, Zorin, Linux Lite, Ubuntu. Here are the steps I've followed. 1.) Place flash drive into Windows PC 2.) Use Unetbootin/win32diskimager/universal-usb-installer to load the distro's .iso onto the flash drive 3.) Put the successfully loaded flash drive into the Acer 4.) Turn on the Acer 5.) Push F12 to choose Boot Priority 6.) Ensure that the flash drive I'm generally a Windows/Mac user, but I really REALLY wanna get into Linux. I don't care which Linux distro I start off with, however I've used Ubuntu 13.10 for a few days, I'm LOVING it so far. HOWEVER, there's ALWAYS a problem, at first it was the drivers for the graphics card, then the mouse freezes on me for a while, like I can see the cursor and still move it, but it doesn't function, can't click anything at all. Then just this morning the volume is too low, then I read that it's an unfix. I've just started using Zorin Linux after using Windows 8.1 and one nice little thing I miss is how Windows 8.1 on multiple screens can be set to have a taskbar on multiple screens and can be set to show only the applications open on that screen on that screen's taskbar. Zorin uses Awn for it's taskbar by default, but I don't mind changing it up to try and make this happen. I had a quick Google for Applets for Awn, but I could not find anything obvious. I'm running Zorin My father is a troll. I currently work in IT and am working towards a promotion. Said promotion requires a basic, introductory, knowledge of Linux. My father, having been working in IT since 1994, offered to help me and gave me a laptop and Linux on a flash drive and told me to have fun. The laptop is Panasonic Toughbook. Nothing fancy and pretty slow, but it works. Except that it has a password and the admin account is one that is not mine. If I plug the computer in from being I been getting a lot of Linux magazines and other magazines and one of them have an article about Zorin OS. I read up on it and sound interesting. Have any of you play with Zorin OS and if you had, how do you like it? I been thinking that I might put it on my Thinkpad ( I have Ubuntu on it right now) but I want to get some feedback from the Linux community before 
I've had Ubuntu on my laptop for about 6 months and have used it very little. The biggest reason was I hadn't setup my VPN on it and needed to migrate to a new password manager. I started setting up my VPN yesterday and plainly did not enjoy moving about the UI. I had read up on adding Plasma as a DE, but decided this morning to jump right into Kubuntu. Now I run Kubuntu on my laptop, Debian Stretch headless on my PC, and Ubuntu 16.04 headless on my other PC. The headless units are nearly I have a relatively old laptop that is currently running Zorin OS 12.4, which I've decided to use until I can afford a better work laptop. The only problem is, it only has 3.7 GB of available memory (0.3 GB is likely reserved for the integrated GPU), and having two particularly 'heavy' tabs in Opera (eg. YouTube videos) pretty much seems to take all of that already. So, here's the question; what can I do to reduce the amount of memory used by Opera without running into near-constant freeze.

So recently I received a desktop from a friend that came loaded with linux on it. Heres the problem though, I can't figure out how to get games to work on it.
